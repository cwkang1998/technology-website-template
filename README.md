# Technology Company Website Template

A simple technology company website template written in html, css and javascript.

## Aim

This project (for now) aims to be a reason for me to learn more in depth pure css styling, as well as learn to replicate some of the popular design pattern. This project also serves to provide a reason for me to create some of the tools I would need for my day to day job.
